# Nextbus Compare

##Description:
The functional goal of this React app is to find transit arrival time by the station code.
The NextBus app used to do, but not any more. When a station have stop code on display, it is often much quicker and more convienant to type in the 5 digit code than to search for street sign to get the cross street and than try to remember if the bus is inbound or outbound.
The programming goal is to try out the NextBus API and to practice React, which I just learn.

##Progress:
For now, the console logs out the data correctly. I am also able to output them. As always, I have basic implemented web accessibility and web security best practices. Real-time input validation has been implemented, the React way. Very fun to do.

##To-Do:
* Style the output data.
* Allow user to add multiple transit line (3 max) so they can compare them (hence the name Nextbus Compare).
* Allow user to remove transit line.
