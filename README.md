# Nextbus Compare

##Description:
The functional goal of this React app is to find transit arrival time by the station code.
I think the NextBus app used to take in stop code as input, but not any more. When a station have stop code on display, it is often much quicker and more convienant to type in the 5 digit code than to search for street sign to get the cross street and than try to remember if the bus is inbound or outbound.
In addition, the app also allows user to compare up to 3 transit stops, which can be useful if the user have several transit option and want to compare them.

The programming goal is to try out the NextBus API and to practice React that I recently learned.
As always, I have basic implemented web accessibility and web security best practices.
Real-time input validation has been implemented, the React way. Very fun to do.
I still need to do a tab navigation and screen reader test to be sure.
